(1, 'Rice', 'Climatic Requirements:\nIn India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice cultivation in India extends from 8 to35ºN latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters. Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water. The average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 37º C. Maximum temp which the crop can tolerate 400C to 42 0C.\n\nCrop Production Practices:\nIn India Rice is mainly grown in two types of soils i.e., (i) uplands and (ii) low lands. The method of cultivation of rice in a particular region depends largely on factors such as situation of land, type of soils, irrigation facilities, availability of labourers intensity and distribution of rainfalls. The crop of rice is grown with the following methods-\n(1)Dry or Semi-dry upland cultivation-\n    (1.1)Broadcasting the seed.\n    (1.2)Sowing the seed behind the                                        plough or drilling.\n(2)Wet or lowland cultivation-\n    (2.1)Transplanting in puddled fields.\n    (2.2)Broadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled fields.\n\nSelection of Seeds:\nThe use of quality seeds in cultivation of rice is an important factor to get better crop yield. Therefore, proper care has to be taken in selecting seeds of the best quality. Much of the success in raising the healthy seedlings depends on the quality of seed. Seeds intended for sowing should satisfy the following requirements-\n(1)The seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown.\n(2)The seed should be clean and free from obvious mixtures of other seeds.\n(3)The seed should be mature, well developed and plump in size.\n(4)The seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.\n(5)The seed should have a high germinating capacity.\n\nBefore sowing the seed should be treated with fungicides which protects the seed against soil-born fungi and also give a boost to the seedlings.', 2450, 5000),
(2, 'Urd Dal', 'Climate required in Black Gram Cultivation: \r\nThis crop prefers dry whether condition with ideal  temperature range between 25 C to 35 C. Maturity crop period should coincide with the dry  whether condition for high yield and good quality seeds, this is one of the main criteria to decide time of planting.\r\n\r\nSoil requirement: \r\nSoil in Black Gram cultivation should have neutral pH. Loam or clay loam soils are best suited soils for it’s cultivation. Adding higher organic matter in soil will result in vigorous seed production.\r\n\r\nSelection of land and it’s Preparation in Black Gram Cultivation:\r\nThe field selected for seed production must not have been sown with black gram in the previous years. This is done to avoid volunteer plants that cause admixture. Fields continuously cultivated with black gram may harbour root rot or wilt pathogen.\r\n\r\nFertilizers: Basal fertilizers application alone may not be sufficient for the seed crop. It is mandatory to provide nutrition during the heavy growth of crop and seed formation period. The nutrient needed by the rapidly developing pulse seeds are provided through foliar feeding.\r\n     Nutrient solution preparation is done by soaking the following chemicals in water (100 lit). This solution is sprayed 25 to 35 days after seed sowing followed by another spray in 40 to 50 days.\r\n\r\n', 4196, 10000),
(3, 'Brinjal', 'Climate:\r\nThe brinjal is a warm season crop, therefore susceptible to severe frost. Low temperature during the cool season causes deformation of fruits. A long and warm growing season is desirable for successful brinjal production. Cool nights and short summers are unsuited to satisfactory yield.  A daily mean temperature of 13 to 21C is most favourable for optimum growth and yield. The brinjal seed germinate well at 25C.\r\n\r\nSoil and Field Preparation:\r\nThe brinjal can be grown in all types of soil varying from light sandy to heavy clay. Light soils are good for an early yield, while clay-loam and silt-loam are well suited for higher yield. Loam and sandy soil of normal and higher status are best suited for brinjal cultivation. The soil should fertile and well drained. Brinjal is very hardy crop and can be grown even in adverse conditions like in soil having high pH Brinjal has great adoptability \r\n     Since the crop remain in the field for a number of months. The soil should be thoroughly prepared by ploughing 4 to 5 times before transplanting the seedlings. Bulky organic manures like well rotten crowding or compost should be incorporated evenly on the soil.\r\n\r\nManure and Fertilizers:\r\nBrinjal is a heavy feeder crop. Therefore a balance application of manure and    fertilizers is very important for important for successful crop production. Further the brinjal being a long duration crop requires a good amount of manure and fertilizers. Well rotten farmyard manure or compost (200-250 q/ha) should be incorporated at the time of field preparation. The crop should be supplemented with 100-120 kg nitrogen and 50-60 kg each of phosphorus and potash hybrid requires more amount of fertilizers. Full dose of phosphorus and potash and half of N is applied at the of final field preparation before transplanting and the remaining quantity of N as urea is applied in two to three splits after 30, 45 and 60 days of transplanting in the farm of top dressing. \r\n\r\nSowing Time:\r\nThe time of sowing of seed and transplanting of seedlings varies according to the agro-climatic regions. In the plants of Northern India, there are generally two sowing season’s vez, June to July for autumn crop and November for the spring- summer crop month of April. In South India, the brinjal can be grown round the year, the main sowing being done during July to August. In the hills, the seeds are sown in March to April and seedlings are transplanted in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 200, 4600),
(4, 'Banana', 'Climate:\r\nThe edible bananas are restricted to tropical or neartropical regions, roughly the area between latitudes 30°N and 30°S. Within this band, there are varied climates with different lengths of dry season and different degrees and patterns of precipitation. A suitable banana climate is a mean temperature of 80°F (26.67°C) and mean rainfall of 4 in (10 cm) per month. There should not be more than 3 months of dry season.\r\n     Cool weather and prolonged drought retard growth. Banana plants produce only one leaf per month in winter, 4 per month in summer. If low temperatures occur just at flowering time, the bud may not be able to emerge from the stem. If fruits have already formed, maturity may be delayed several months or completely suspended. If only the leaves are destroyed, the fruits will be exposed to sunburn. Smudging, by burning dry trash covered with green clippings to create smoke, can raise the temperature 2 to 4 degrees. Flooding the field in advance of a cold snap will keep the ground warm if the chill weather is brief. In Australia, bananas are planted on sunny hill sides at elevations of 200 to 1,000 ft (60 to 300 m) to avoid the cold air that settles at lower levels. Brief frosts kill the plants to the ground but do not destroy the corm. \'Dwarf Cavendish\' and the \'Red\' banana are particularly sensitive to cold, whereas the dwarf cultivar \'Walha\', or \'Kullen\', of India is successful up to 4,000 ft (1,220 m) in the outer range of the Western Ghats. \'Vella vazhai\' is extensively cultivated in the Lower Pulneys between 3,200 and 5,500 ft (975 and 1,616 m). A cooking banana, \'Plankel\', survives winters in home gardens in northern India. In South Africa, the main banana-producing area is along the southeast coast at 3,000 ft (915 m) above sea level with summer rainfall of 35 to 45 in (90-115 cm). The major part of the crop in East Africa is grown between 4,000 and 5,000 ft (1,220 and 1,524 m) and the total range extends from sea-level to 7,500 ft (2,286 m).\r\n     Wind is detrimental to banana plants. Light winds shred the leaves, interfering with metabolism; stronger winds may twist and distort the crown. Winds to 30 mph break the petioles; winds to 40 mph will topple a pseudostem that is supporting the weight of a heavy bunch unless the stem is propped, and may cause root damage in non fruiting plants that are not blown down; winds of 60 mph or over will uproot entire plantations, especially when the soil is saturated by rain. Windbreaks are often planted around banana fields to provide some protection from cold and wind. Cyclones and hurricanes are devastating and the latter were the main reason for the shift of large scale banana production from the West Indies to Central America, Colombia and Ecuador. Hail results from powerful convection currents in the tropics, especially in the spring, and does much damage to bananas.\r\n\r\nSoil:\r\nThe banana plant will grow and fruit under very poor conditions but will not flourish and be economically productive without deep, well-drained soil—loam, rocky sand, marl, red laterite, volcanic ash, sandy clay, even heavy clay—but not fine sand which holds water. Over head irrigation is said to improve the tilth of heavy clay and has made possible the use of clay soils that would never have been considered for banana culture in the past. Alluvial soils of river valleys are ideal for banana growing. Bananas prefer an acid soil but if the pH is below 5.0 lime should be applied the second year. Low pH makes bananas more susceptible to Panama disease. Where waterlogging is likely, bananas and plantains are grown on raised beds. Low, perennially wet soils require draining and dry soils require irrigation.\r\n\r\nPropagation:\r\nBanana seeds are employed for propagation only in breeding programs. Corms are customarily used for planting and Mexican studies with \'Giant Cavendish\' have shown that those over 17.5 lbs (8 kg) in weight come into bearing early and, in the first year, the bunches are longer, heavier, with more hands than those produced from smaller corms. From the second year on, the advantage disappears. Most growers prefer \"bits\" 2- to 4-lb (0.9-1.8 kg) sections of the corm. When corms are scarce, smaller sections—1 to 2 lbs (454-908 g) have been utilized and early fertilization applied to compensate for the smaller size. But in Queensland it is specified that \"bits\" of \'Dwarf Cavendish\' shall not be less than 4 x 3 x 3 in (10 x 7.5 x 7.5 cm) and \"bits\" of \'Lady Finger\' and other tall cultivars shall be not less than 5 x 5 x 3 1/2 in ( 12.5 x 12.5 x 9 cm). The corm has a number of buds, or \"eyes\", which develop into new shoots. The two upper buds are the youngest and have a pinkish tint. These develop rapidly and become vigorous plants. To obtain the \"bits\", a selected, healthy banana plant, at least 7 months old but prior to fruiting, is uprooted and cut off about 4 to 5 in (10-12.5 cm) above the corm. The outer layer of leaf bases is peeled off to expose the buds, leaving just a little to protect the buds during handling and transport. The corm is split between the 2 upper buds and trimmed with square sides, removing the lower, inferior buds and any parts affected by pests or disease, usually indicated by discoloration. Then the \"bits\" are fumigated by immersing for 20 minutes in hot water at about 130°F (54.44°C) or in a commercial nematicide solution. Sometimes it is advisable to apply a fungicide to prevent spoilage. They should then be placed in a sanitary place (away from all diseased trash) in the shade for 48 hrs before planting.\r\n     Inasmuch as \"bits\" are not often available in quantity, the second choice is transplantation of suckers. These should not be too young nor too old.\r\n     The sucker first emerges as a conical shoot which opens and releases leaves that are mostly midribs with only vestiges of blade. These juvenile leaves are called \"sword\", \"spear\", or \"arrow\", leaves. Just before the sucker produces wide leaves resembling those of the mature plant but smaller, it has sufficient corm development to be transplanted. Sometimes suckers from old, deteriorating corms have broad leaves from the outset. These are called \"water\" suckers, are insubstantial, with very little vigor, and are not desirable propagating material. \"Maiden\" suckers that have passed the \"sword\"-leaved stage and have developed broad leaves must be large to be acceptably productive. In banana trials at West Bengal, India, suckers 3 to 4 months old with well-developed rhizomes proved to be the best yielders. In comparison, small, medium, or large \"sword\" suckers develop thicker stems, and give much higher yields of marketable fruits per land parcel. \"Bits\' grow slowly at first, but in 2 years\' time they catch up to plants grown from suckers or \"butts\" and are much more economical. \"Butts\" (entire corms, or rhizomes, of mature plants), called \"bull heads\" in the Windward Islands, are best used to fill in vacancies in a plantation. For quick production, some farmers will use \"butts\" with several \"sword\" suckers attached. Very young suckers, called \"peepers\", are utilized only for establishing nurseries.\r\n     Instead of waiting for normal sucker development, multiplication has been artificially stimulated in the field by removing the soil and outer leaf sheaths covering the upper buds of the corm, packing soil around them and harvesting them when they have reached the \"sword\' sucker stage. A greenhouse technique involves cleaning and injuring a corm to induce callus formation from which many new plants will develop. As many as 180 plantlets have been derived from one corm in this manner.\r\n', 500, 5000),
(5, 'Sesasum', 'Soil Requirement for Sesame Farming:\r\nThe sesame crop grown as summer crop, Kharif crop and also as semi-rabi crop. Sesame thrives well on soils with neutral reaction (or) slightly acidic type. There should not be any water stagnation in the soil, so make sure soil is well drained and light loamy soil for better growth performance. The preferred soil pH range of sesame crop is 5.5 to 8.0. Saline soils or too much sandy soils are not suitable for sesame cultivation. Adding well rotten Farm Yard Manure to the soil is beneficial in getting higher yields.\r\n\r\nClimatic Condition required for Sesame Farming:\r\nThis crop can be cultivated @ elevations up to 1250 m. Sesame crop does not grown in frost conditions., Prolonged drought  (or) heavy rains are not favourable conditions for its cultivation. Sesame crop is a tropical crop and this crop requires hot conditions during its growth period for best yield. Ideal temperature for sesame cultivation is between 25 °C – 30 °C, Extreme low and very high temperatures effect the growth.\r\n\r\nLand Preparation in Sesame Farming:\r\nThe land should be ploughed by tractor or desi/country plough and harrowed repeatedly for bridging the soil to fine tilth and weed free for quick germination as the sesame seeds are small. Add appropriate Farm Yard Manure while preparing the soil or beds.\r\n\r\nSeed Rate and Seed Treatment in Sesame Farming:\r\nSeed rate depends on sowing method and variety of seed. And season In broadcasting method, under rain fed conditions seed rate would be 6 kg/hectare, under irrigated conditions 5 kg/hectare. in row seeding, under rain fed condition seed rate would be 5 kg/hectare, under irrigated condition 4 kg/hectare. If sesame is cultivated as intercrop, seed rate would be 1 kg/hectare.Treat the seeds with Thiram (3 grams / kg of seeds) to prevent seed borne diseases. Just before seeding, seeds should be soaked in 0.03% Agrimycin- 100 solution for 25 to 30 minutes to minimize leaf spot disease.\r\n\r\nSowing and Spacing in Sesame Farming: Sowing of sesame can be done in broadcast or line. However sowing the seeds in lines is preferred. Mixing the seed with dry sand (1 time seed: 4 times dry sand) and spread the mixture along the furrows to ensure even distribution. 3cm depth is enough for sowing the seeds and cover the seeded area with soil. Make row-to-row spacing of 25 cm to 35 cm and plant-to-plant spacing of 10 cm to 20 cm.\r\n\r\nWeed Control/Intercultural Operations in Sesame Farming:\r\nFirst 15 to 25 days after sowing is crucial for weeding. The irrigated sesame crop requires frequent weeding operations where as rainfed crop requires once or twice. One weeding should be carried out @ 2 weeks of sowing and another one @ 30 to 35 days to keep the crop weed free. Row seeded sesame crop requires blade harrowing for intercultivation.2 such tasks should be carried out 1 is @ 15 days (after sowing) other one is @ 30 to 35 days (after sowing) followed by one hand weeding. Use herbicides Thiobencarb (2.0kg/hectare) (or) Alachlor (1kg/hectare) as pre emergence spray to control the weeds.\r\n\r\nIrrigation in Sesame Farming:\r\nIrrigate the field @ sowing to keep enough moisture for good germination. Depending upon the soil type and climatic condition, provide life irrigation @ 7 days after sowing.There are 3 critical stages of watering in sesame farming, first one @ pre-flowering stage (22-25 days after sowing), second one @  flowering stage (35 to 45 days after sowing) & 1 (or) 2 irrigations @ pod setting stage. During the seed maturity stage, maintain low moisture status because seed maturity is affected and filling up of the capsules would be poor. Hence, stop watering after 65 to 70 days of sowing.\r\n\r\nManures and Fertilizers in Sesame Farming:\r\nAdd 5 to 6 tonnes of Farm Yard Manure (F.M.Y) or well rotten compost at the time of soil preparation. Fertilizers for rainfed and irrigated conditions are as follows:\r\n\r\nRainfed Crop–>  ½ basal ·  N 40 kg/hectare.  P 60 kg/hectare (30 to 35 days after sowing).  K 40 kg/hectare.\r\n\r\nIrrigated Crop –>   ½ basal ·  N 60 kg/hectare.  P 61 kg/hectare (30 to 35 days after sowing).  K 40 kg/hectare.\r\n     Note:Applying of fertilizer @ seeding using seed drills is more effective than broadcast method.\r\n\r\nPests and Diseases in Sesame Farming: Caterpillar and Gall fly are the main pests in the sesame cultivation. To control these, apply 2 sprays of caterpillar and gall fly (or) Carbaryl 0.2% on 40 th and 60 th day after sowing. Other diseases found in sesame farming are Phyllody or leaf-curl and leaf-spot. To control leaf-spot, apply 3 sprays of Agrimycin @  the rate of 100 PPM at 2 weeks interval and to control Phyllody or leaf-curl, spray Dimethoate 0.05% (or) Phosphomidan.\r\n\r\nHarvesting of Sesame Seed:\r\nDepending on the variety, this crop comes to maturity in 3 to 5 months. Harvesting can be started when the leaves, stems and capsules begin to turn yellow and the lower leaves of the plant start shedding. Don’t wait until the crop becomes dead ripe which will cause the shedding of seed. The ripe sesame plants should be cut @ the ground level and should be stacked for 7 to 10 days in sun to make them ready for threshing.\r\n', 5000, 5925),
(6, 'Sorghum', 'Climatic requirements for Sorghum (or) Jowar Farming:- \r\nBasically jowar or sorghum is a tropical crop. It thrives well at a temperature between 25°C and 32°C but below 16°C is not good for the crop. Jowar crop requires rainfall about 40 cm annually. Jowar is extreme drought tolerant crop and recomended for dry regions. Too much of moist and pro longed dry conditions are not suitable for jowar cultivation.\r\n\r\nSoil Requirements for Sorghum (or) Jowar Farming:- \r\nSorghum or Jowar crop adapts wide range of soils but grows well in sandy loam soils having good drainage. Soil pH range of 6 to 7.5 is ideal for its cultivation and better growth. The main field should be ploughed and leveled to fine tilth for weeds free sowing.\r\n\r\nLand Selection and Field Preparation in Jowar Farming:- \r\nOne should avoid rocky field and 1 to 2 ploughings followed by 2 crosswise harrowing are required to prepare a good seed bed. As the Sorghum or Jowar crop does not tolerate water lagging, the field should be prepared with well drainage.\r\n\r\nSeed rate and Sowing in Sorghum or Jowar Farming:- \r\nSeed rate of 35-40 kg per hectare is well enough and sowing should be carried out by drilling @ row-to-row distance of 25 cm. Seed broadcasting should be avoided. The seed should not be sowed more than 2 – 3 cm depth.\r\n\r\nManures and Fertilization in Sorghum or Jowar Farming:- \r\nThe main field should be added with 10 to15 tone of Farm Yard Manure (F.Y.M) to make the soil rich in micro nutrients. At the time of sowing, basal application of 60:40:40kg N: P2O5-K2O should be applied. Should apply 35kg N/ha top dressing 1 month after sowing. 60 to 65 kg N per hectare should be applied In low rainfall and rain fed areas at sowing time.  In Sulphur deficient soils, 45 to 60 kg Sulphur /ha should be added which not only improves biomass but also quality. For any other nutrient deficiencies, soil test should be done and accordingly, apply the manures and fertilizers at the time of soil preparation.\r\n\r\nIrrigation in Sorghum or Jowar Farming:-  If the crop is sown in monsoon time (July). it may require l to 3 irrigations depending upon rains. For summer crops, 6 to 7 irrigations may be carried out due to high temperature. In South India, Rabi season crops need about 4 to 5 irrigations.\r\n\r\nWeed control/Inter culture operations in Jowar Farming:- \r\nTo control the weeds in Sorghum crop, weeder cum mulcher should be used to give 1hoeing @ 3 weeks crop stage. Should use pre-emergence application of atrazine @ 0.50 kg/ha in 650 liters of water to control the weeds effectively.\r\n\r\nDiseases and Insects in Jowar Farming:- Sorghum crop prone to many insects and diseases.\r\n\r\nInsects/Pests in Sorghum or Jowar Farming: Stem borer, shootfly, stem borer & sorghum midge.\r\n\r\nHow to control?  Use spray of carbofuran/malathion @ 125 ml/ha, to control sorghum midge, use spray of endosulphan @ 0.075.\r\n\r\nDiseases in Sorghum Jowar Farming : Sooty stripe, anthracnose, and zonate leaf spot.\r\n\r\nSeed treatment is very important in sorghum farming, treat seeds with Thiram@ 3 grams/kg seed and this takes care of almost all diseases. Spray carbendazim @ 5grams /liter water  to control anthracnose disease in early stages. Summer sown crop is very prone to shoot fly. For this carbofuran 3G@ 3 to 4 kg/ha should be applied to control shoot fly at sowing time. To control or avoid stem borers, crop should be sown during July season. Using spray of endosulfan @ 0.05% , 2 to 3 times at 10 to 14 days interval is also effective.\r\n\r\nHarvesting of Jowar:- \r\nThe crop will be ready in single cut varieties for harvesting @ 65 to 75 days after sowing (50%, flowering stage). In multi cut varieties, first cut should be done @ 45-50 days and subsequent cuts should be carried at 1 month intervals.\r\n\r\nYield of Jowar:- \r\nGood  farm management practices and good variety of Sorghum/ Jowar can yield up ro 1000 kg/ha.\r\n', 1150, 2350),
(7, 'Bajra', 'Agro-climatic requirement for Bajra Cultivation:- \r\nBajra grows well in dry and warm climatic conditions and it’s drought  tolerant crop which requires low annual rainfall ranging between 40 cm to 60 cm. Ideal temperature for bajra cultivation is between 20 °C to 30 °C. Moist weather is advantageous during its vegetative growth. In North India, bajra is grown as kharif crop and in some southern parts is grown as summer crop providing Irrigation.\r\n\r\nSoil Requirement for Bajra Cultivation:- Bajra can be grown in wide range of soils. However, It thrives best in black cotton soils, sandy loam soils having well drainage. This crop does not prefer acidic and water logging soils. Avoid saturated soils for its cultivation. It grows successfully well in soils with low pH (or) high salinity. Bajra can be easily grown in regions where other cereal crops like wheat or maize would not survive.\r\n\r\nLand or Field Preparation in Bajra Cultivation:- \r\n2 to 3 harrowing followed by a ploughing is required to make the soil in the field to the fine tilth. Any weeds should be destroyed during the field preparation to accommodate proper sowing and distribution of seed at appropriate depth.\r\n\r\nSeed treatment in Bajra Cultivation:- The organo mercurial compound Ceresan, Agrosan should be used @ 2 – 3 kg per hectare to control seed borne diseases.\r\n\r\nSeed rate and Spacing in Bajra Cultivation:- \r\nSeed rate and spacing in bajra cultivation as follows:\r\n•3 to 3.5 kg/ha for dibbling method.\r\n•5 to 5 kg/ha for drilling method.\r\n\r\nRow spacing of 40 cm to 45 cm should be maintained and within rows, 10 cm – 15 cm should be kept.\r\n\r\nSowing time in Bajra Cultivation:- Ideal time for Bajra sowing time is middle to last week of July month.\r\n\r\nWeed control & Inter cultural Operations in Bajra Cultivation:- \r\nGap filling or Thinning is followed,  Applying  Atrazine @ 0.5 kg/ha works well to control weeds.\r\n\r\nManures and Fertilizers in Bajra Cultivation:- \r\nEven Bajra requires less nutrients, If you are cultivating commercial hybrid bajra, adding Farm Yard Manure (F.M.Y) or Compost result in better yield and quality of seed. Apply these organic manures at the time of soil or land preparation so that soil will become fully decomposed by the time of sowing. 90 –100 kg of N: 50-60 kg of  P: 50-60 kg of K is recommended for hybrid variety.\r\n\r\nFertilizers should be applied in split doses. At the time of sowing, full phosphorus and potash and half of nitrogen should be added as basal application. 1/4 th nitrogen should be added after 30 and 60 days (after sowing).\r\n\r\nPests and Diseases in Bajra Cultivation:- \r\nGrasshoppers and stem bores are major pests in bajra cultivation. These can be controlled by dusting the crop with BHC 5 % (or) 2 sprayings with 2 liters of Eldrin 20 c.c. Main disease in Bajra farming is “Downy mildew” ,to control this disease, treat the seeds with fungicide like M-45 @ 2.0kg/ha (or) Dithane Z-78 in 900 -1000 liters of water.\r\n\r\nHarvesting and Threshing of Bajra crop:- The crop is ready for harvesting when  the grain become hardy & contain moisture. Two methods can be followed in harvesting bajra crop: Cutting earhead  or cutting of entire plants by sticks. stalk the cut plants for 4 to 5 days in sun for drying grains. Grains can be separated by beating the earheads.\r\n\r\nYield of Bajra:- Rain fed crop yields about 12 to 16 quintals/ha and irrigated crop yields about 25 to 35 quintals/ha.\r\n', 1350, 1450),
(8, 'Groundnut', 'Suitable Soil for Groundnut Farming :\r\nGroundnut is perfectly grown in a well-drained sandy loam, or sandy clay loam s oil. Deep well-drained soils with a pH of 6.5-7.0 and high fertility, are ideal for groundnut. An optimum soil temperature for good germination of groundnut is 30°C. Low temperature at sowing delays germination and increases seed and seedling diseases. Soil test must be done before starting a groundnut farming.\r\n\r\nCrop rotation in Groundnut Farming: \r\nA crop rotation is very important in groundnut farming , this helps in efficient nutrient utilization and reduces soil borne diseases and nematodes. It also helps to reduce the incidence of weeds. Maize, sorghum, pearl millet or small grain crops can be grown following groundnut. To reduce the incidence of soil borne diseases it is recommended not to grow groundnut after groundnut, or tobacco, or cotton.\r\n\r\nApplication of Manures and Fertilizers in Groundnut Farming :\r\nIn Groundnut farming, a balanced fertilizer application, based on soil tests, should provide adequate levels of especially phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sulphur, and magnesium . Nutrient availability depends on soil pH , organic matter content, and rate of release of nutrients from the soil minerals. The availability of other essential ions such as copper, boron, iron, manganese, and nitrogen may be low in alkaline soils (pH >8.5); while an acid soil (pH <6) may be deficient in molybdenum, manganese, sulphur, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium. Therefore, depending on soil nutrient status and  targeted yields.\r\n\r\nManure Application in Ground Farming:\r\nIn Groundnut farming, application of 1 0 – 1 2 t ha-1 of chicken manure or 20 t ha-1 of well decomposed farm yard-manure should be used and completed at least 1 month before sowing. This should be mixed into the soil for good plant development and to improve the soil structure.\r\n\r\nFertilizers Application in Groundnut Farming: \r\nThe main Fertilizer components in Groundnut Farming are Nitrogen , Phosphorus ,Potassium ,Calcium , Sulphur , Iron ,Zinc. Deficiencies of boron , copper, molybdenum, manganese and magnesium  can be corrected by soil application of these nutrients when symptoms appear, depending on soil type and agroclimatic conditions.\r\n\r\nSowing Preparation in Groundnut Farming:\r\nPlot design:When  testing for yield a n d quantitative characters, treatments are to be randomized and arranged in the plots in blocks. The plot size is four rows of 4m length, with 30 cm between rows and 10 cm between plants.\r\n\r\nSeed and Layout Preparation in Groundnut farming :\r\n1.Initial steps: The experimental field maps indicating the randomization of treatments, blocks, direction of rows, number of rows, row width, row length, and alley width are prepared. Next, the seed and fertilizer packets for each  row are prepared. \r\n2.Selection of seed: Bold and well-filled pods are s elected for shelling about one week before sowing. The viability of the kernels may deteriorate after being shelled and stored for a long time a n d are more subject to storage pest damage. The plants produced from bold kernels were found to be superior to those from correspondingly smaller kernels in their rate of emergence, number of successful seedlings, number of primary branches and leaves, and dry mass of roots, shoots, total dry matter, and pod yield.\r\n3.Seed treatment:To control pathogens causing seed and seedling diseases, it is necessary to coat the seed before sowing with either Thiram® (a.i. 5 0 % @ 3 g kg -1 seed) or Bavistin® (a.i. 5 0 % @ 2 g kg’ 1 seed). Seed may be inoculated at the time of sowing by field inoculation to ensure good nodulation where a soil has been found to contain few rhizobia.\r\n4.Seed rate and spacing. The seed rate depends on the variety (Spanish, Valencia, o r Virginia), runner or bunch type, the seed mass, and germination rate of the seed-lot . The recommended population for bunch varieties is 330 000 plants ha -1 (about one plant per 30 x 10 cm).  In case of semi spreading and spreading varieties the recommended population is 250 000 plants ha -1 (one plant per 40 x 10 cm). \r\n5.Seed  packets: When sowing by hand is done the calculated a m o u n t of seed for each row is separately packeted and the packets for each plot are temporarily fastened together. In case of machine sowing, seed packets are arranged by groups of rows for continuous sowing.\r\n\r\nSowing in Groundnut Farming :\r\n1.Groundnut sowing during the rainy season start with the onset of the rains, usually by the 3rd week of June.\r\n2.Examine the soil before sowing for an optimum moisture content after rainfall or give a presowing irrigation to make sure good germination .\r\n3.At the time of sowing, place the seed at 5-6 cm depth in the soil. Compact the soil around the seed to ensure there is firm contact with soil moisture for rapid and uniform germination. Use of a seed drill with packing wheels is useful to ensure uniform germination.\r\n4.When sowing manually, make sure that plots in each block is completed by the same person to reduce within-block variation due to uneven sowing caused by human differences.\r\n\r\nIrrigation in Groundnut Farming :\r\nGroundnut farming sprinkler irrigation\r\n•Groundnut yields will be reduced if the upper soil zone becomes dry from f lowering through pod development. A water deficit may lead to the following consequences.\r\n•Reduction in the dry matter production of vegetative components as well as the crop growth rate. Fewer and smaller leaves with small compact cells and shorter stems. Water deficit from sowing to 67 days delays the period of rapid fruit growth by 10 days and decreases yield.\r\n•Water deficit during the flowering and pegging stages results in higher yield losses than stress at any other growth stage; This deficit reduces the number of f lowers plant-1.\r\n•Water deficit in the soil surface during peg formation and pod development reduces pod number and pod yield.\r\n•Water deficit in the fruiting zone results in unfilled pods , and less calcium concentration in the hull and seed .\r\n•Water deficit reduces groundnut quality, shelling percentage or percentage of sound mature seeds, seed mass, and germination of seed.\r\n\r\nThe aim  of irrigation is to prevent soil water deficit and to supply the crop’s upper rooting zone with sufficient moisture without water logging the root zone.\r\n•Adequate available water in the upper 60 cm layer of soil is important for high yield and good quality groundnut seeds. Most s oils when at field capacity will hold about 3.1 cm of water at 30 cm of depth. The highest groundnut yields are observed when available soil moisture is kept above 50 % of field capacity. Therefore, sprinkler irrigation is recommended when the moisture has been depleted to 50 % of field capacity in the top 60 c m . During peak water-use periods (0.6-0.7 cm day-1) the field m a y require 3.0-3.5 cm of water every 5 days. Irrigation intervals can be prolonged for 7-10 days during periods of low daily water requirements. \r\n•An optimum water management scheme is to schedule sprinkler irrigation to maintain a less than 50 % SWD (soil water depletion) level in the top 30 cm of soil during early growth stages. Imposing a moderate water deficit during pre-f lowering phase followed by irrigation can increase pod yields by 18 – 20 %. However, irrigation should be made at 2 5 % SWD during the pod-formation and seed-development st ages. If the soil water potential is measured , irrigation should be maintained the soil water potential above -0.6 bars.When long, dry, hot, periods occur at the sensitive growth stages, such as pegging, pod format ion, and early pod filling, sprinkler irrigation are necessary to maintain the soil water potential above -0.25 to -0.50 bars . This means that the upper 30 cm of soil should appear and feel moist and the plants should not wilt from lack of moisture during the afternoon.\r\n\r\nWeed Control in Groundnut Farming :\r\nWeeds cause much damage to the groundnut crop during the first 45 days of its growth. The most critical period of weed competition is from 3-6 weeks after sowing. The average yield loss due to weeds is about 30 % ,whereas under poor management yield loss by weeds may be 60 %. Therefore, it is advantageous to mechanically and chemically control weeds during the initial 6 weeks of groundnut growth.\r\n\r\nHarvesting in Groundnut Farming : \r\nPremature harvesting of groundnut pods lowers the yield, oil percent age, and quality of seeds. Delay in harvesting after physiological maturity can result in increased Aspergillus flavus infection, and aflatoxin contamination in pods/seeds, and many pods may be left in the soil due to weakening of pegs. The Spanish bunch varieties (nondormant types) start germinating if harvesting is delayed. Therefore, it is important to harvest at optimum maturity.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways of harvesting in Groundnut Farming :\r\n1.Apply sprinkler irrigation for an hour and manually pull the plants.\r\n2.Provide a light surface irrigation 2 – 3 days before harvest a n d use a blade harrow that cuts the plant roots 1 2 – 1 5 cm below the soil surface. Then manually pull the plants.\r\n3.W h e n irrigation water is scarce, use a plow or tractor-driven digger to loosen the soil. Then manually remove the plants.\r\n\r\nNote: Harvested plants should be stacked in the field for a few days for air and sun drying (on bright sunny days) before stripping the pods. Thereafter, pods are continuously dried to reach a moisture content of 6 – 6 % to avoid the development of aflatoxin caused by yellow mold (Aspergillus flavus). On cloudy days, pods should be removed and immediately placed in an air drier at 27-38°C for 2 days or until the pods dry to a constant mass ( 6 – 8 % moisture).\r\n\r\nStorage of Groundnut:\r\nAfter cleaning and grading, store the dry pods in gunny bags and stack them up to 10 bags high in separated stacks so that air freely circulates among them . The bags should be piled on wooden planks to avoid damage from dampness. Dusting the bags with 5% Lindane® will protect the pods from many storage pests.\r\n', 3575, 4200),
(9, 'Cotton', 'Climate and Soil for Cotton Farming :- Hot and moist climate is ideal for cotton farming. The climatic condition for cotton cultivation is mentioned below :\r\n     Seventy percent cotton is rainfed.  Clear sunshine & proper moisture level during boll formation is required. Moisture stress from 60 days to 120 days directly reduces the yield. More sunshine and warm humid climate favours the growth of the cotton crop. Low temperature at boll opening creates problem in harvest.\r\n1.Temperature: 25°C is ideal for cotton cultivation.\r\n2.Rainfall: 150 cm to 200 cm rainfall is essential for cotton faarming. Moisture in the wind is necessary.\r\n3.Soil: Irrigated cotton should be grown on medium black to deep black soil having pH range between 6 to 8. Saline soils are not suitable for cotton cultivation. Soil should have proper drainage. The depth of soil should not be less than 20 to 25 cm. It is advised to go for soil test before cultivating the cotton.\r\n\r\nSoil Preparation in Cotton Farming :-  In Cotton Farming , the preparation of good flat bed is very important. This can be done by ploughing & disc harrowing. Ploughing should be followed by harrowing operation making the fine til soil particle. For advanced method of drip irrigation soil should be well prepared. Add 4 to 5 tons of well decomposed FYM or compost before last harrowing. In the soils having termites or whitegrub, add 750 to 1000 Kg/ha of Neem cake along with FYM.\r\n\r\nCrop Rotation in Cotton Farming :- Cultivating cotton in rotation method is very important.Cotton should be followed by crops like hybrid sorghum, sugarcane, maize, banana etc. Cotton should not be followed by cotton as it increases the pest and disease problems.\r\n\r\nImproved &Hybrid varieties in Cotton:- For irrigated cotton the varieties from G. hirsutam species should be preferred. Also hybrids of Hirsutam x Hirsutam or Hirsutam x Barbadense may be preferred. There are number of varieties that are recommended for growing in India.\r\nRegion wise varieties in India are:\r\n1.Northern Region : LH1134, LH1556, H-4, H-6, MECH-1 etc.\r\n2.Central Region : H-4, JKHY-1, H-6, PKV HY-2, NHH-44, MECH-1,\r\n SHAKTINATH, RCH-2\r\n3.Southern Region : DCH-32, Varlaxmi, Savita, Suvin, HB224, MCU5 etc.\r\n\r\nSelection of Seeds in Cotton Farming:- Only certified and tested seeds should be used for irrigated cotton. Delinted seed is preferred. 2.5 to 3 Kg seed per hectare should be used. Seed should be treated with Thiram or Bavistin. Extra seeds should be utilised for gap filling. Raise the seedling for gap filling in polybags. Fill the gaps during rainy season. Plantation in cotton farming between 7 to 8 thousands per hectare is optimum.\r\n\r\nPlant Spacing in Cotton Farming:- \r\nUnder Micro Irrigation (MIS) Crop geometry may vary to economise the drip system. However optimum plantation per hectare of irrigated hybrid varieties is considered between 7000 to 8000 per hectare. Considering the soil type & varietal characters, spacing in pair row planting can be 2.5? x 5? x 5? or 3? x 4? x 3?. Spacing of 4? x 3? (Heavy Soil) & 3? x 3? (Medium Soil) are adopted in Single row system.\r\n\r\nBest Planting season in Cotton Farming:-  \r\nCotton should be planted before the onset of monsoon so that desired vegetative growth of the plant is achieved. Planting season varies in various regions.\r\n\r\nIrrigation in Cotton Farming :- Drip Irrigation is most effective way of watering in cotton farming\r\n\r\nMain advantages of drip irrigation in cotton farming :-\r\na) Drip Irrigation increases yield of cotton. On an all India basis an yield increase of 27% is recorded (INCID,1994). There are individual farmers cases where yield was doubled by drip irrigation when compared to the yield obtained under furrow / flood irrigation methods. Research into the reasons for such yield increases under drip systems has shown that – yield increases as the interval between water application is decreased even if the total amount of water applied is unchanged. During heavy fruiting mild water stress associated with intermittent irrigations triggered deterioration of the root system which is irreversible. Only high frequency, low intensity drip irrigation can prevent such cyclic water stress.\r\n\r\nb) Drip irrigation makes it possible to grow cotton in all types of soils. Even in a light or shallow soil in which water storage is inadequate to supply the crop over an extended irrigation cycle as is the case with furrow or flood irrigation, drip irrigation provides an opportunity to raise good, high yielding cotton crop.\r\n\r\nc) Because it eliminates intermittent water stress, drip irrigation allows the crop to approach its production potential for more days of the season thus resulting in higher yields.\r\n\r\nd) Drip irrigation is suitable in any type of land / soil management system – flat, ridge and furrow, and bed and furrow systems.\r\n\r\ne) Early planting and establishment of cotton crop is important as part of IPM and for high yields. Drip irrigation proves to be a boon in such situations, especially when the monsoon plays truant.\r\n\r\nf) Drip irrigation results in early and uniform maturity of the crop and improved quality of kapas.\r\n\r\ng) Because of the uniform distribution of water to each plant in the field the growth of plants will be more uniform.\r\n\r\nh) Application of water close to the rootzone keeps weed growth under control. It also reduces the incidence of pests and diseases as the foliage is not wetted and the dry canopy conditions are maintained.\r\n\r\nIntercultivation Operations in Cotton Farming:- \r\nTimely weeding or use of weedicide will minimise the weed population. If soil preparation is properly done before sowing, then intercultivation with hoeing etc. should be minimum in drip irrigation. In pair row planting interspace between two pair rows can be intercultivated by small implements. Mulching can be done in irrigated cotton.\r\n\r\nFertilisers & Fertigation in Cotton Farming:- \r\nThe application of major nutrients like N, P, K and trace elements like iron, boron, magnesium, sulphur, zinc plays a vital role in cotton production. Balanced and timely application K gives better result. Though cotton does not appear to be an exhaustive crop, when grown intensively, high yielding varieties need abundant supply of available nutrients. Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Magnesium are the major nutrients essential for cotton. In India, experiment data reveals that on an average 100 – 125 Kg N, 60 – 75 Kg of P2 O5, 80 Kg of K2O per hectare are recommended. However, it is always advisable to calculate the N, P, K doses after soil analysis report. Under traditional fertilizer application, the entire dose of P & K are added as basal dose and Nitrogen into 3 – 4 split doses. Traditional fertilizer is to be placed well deep into 4 – 5 cm, below the soil near wetted area of the dripper.\r\n\r\nHarvesting and Yield Of Cotton :- \r\nCotton can either be picked by hand or by machines. Manual picking is slow but better preserves fiber characteristics of cotton. Boll opening is the first action on the fiber which pushes fibers from the place where they were embedded for weeks before being exposed to the external conditions. The boll opening action is gentle and thus has no effect on the fiber quality. However, a longer stay of the open bolls in the field may change the color and also make the fibers shrink, thus affecting the three most important fiber characters, i.e. length, strength and micronaire. One character may be affected more than the other if there is a frequent dew. Such an effect cannot be eliminated as all bolls do not open at the same time and some open bolls have to stay in the field for days and sometime even weeks. In the case of hand picking, it is possible to pick open bolls at frequent intervals, and weather effects on the fiber, after bolls have opened, can be minimized. In China (Mainland) this effect is minimized as land holdings are so small that the majority of the growers who have planted cotton on about 1/10th of a hectare, can go many times to the field to pick few open bolls. In slightly bigger plots, fiber quality is preserved through a number of pickings during the season. 3-4 pickings/season are very common in many countries where cotton is hand packed.\r\n\r\nCotton Harvesting:-\r\nCotton yield depends on the management practices with the adoption of advance technology for growing cotton. Cotton crop can give 50-60 quintal/ha yield of kapas under drip irrigation.\r\n\r\nBottom Line :- Initial Investment in cotton farming is high compared to other crops but profits also very high in cotton farming.\r\n', 3800, 6000);

(10, 'Safflower', 'Climate Required for Safflower Cultivation:– \r\nBasically, safflower crops is a cool season (Rabi) crop in India. This crop can be cultivated up to an elevation of 950 to 1000 meter above sea level. Normally, yield and oil content will go down with increase of elevation. The ideal temperature required for this crop is 22°C to 35°C for high yields. The ideal gemination temperature of safflower seed is about 15°C. Temperature plays important role in safflower cultivation. However, high temperatures at flowering stage and temperatures below zero degrees Celsius are harmful for the crop. When it comes to rainfall requirement, this crop is suitable in regions with annual rain fall of 60 to 100 cm and this crop is not suitable in area where heavy rainfall is expected as excessive rainfall or humidity increases the infestation of fungal diseases. Safflower is sensitive to frost conditions and waterlogged conditions cause the crop damage..\r\n\r\nSoil Requirement for Safflower Cultivation:– \r\nSafflower crop can be grown in wide range of soils like sandy loams, clay loams and alluvial shallow and light textured soils. However, well-drained fertile deep soils are the best for safflower cultivation. Low-laying areas should be avoided as waterlogged situations are prone to crop damage. If the crop is grown on large scale, it is advised to go for soil test to find out the fertility of soil. Safflower crop can also be grown successfully in salt affected areas.\r\n\r\nLand Preparation for Safflower Cultivation:– \r\nLand should be ploughed couple of times to bring the soil to fine tilth stage. Any weeds should be removed from previous crops. Any clods should be crushed and levelled in such a way that there won’t be any water logging.\r\n\r\nSeed Preparation and treatment in Safflower Cultivation:-\r\nThe safflower crop requires a clod-free seedbed with sufficient moisture for good germination and establishment of seedlings. Any clods should be crushed to make the soil levelled. The seeds of safflower should be treated with captan or agrosan GN @ 3 grams/kg seed before sowing in the field.\r\n\r\nPropagation, Sowing and Spacing in Safflower Cultivation:- \r\nPropagation is done by seeds. In India, usually this is sown as Rabi season crop from October to November. Avoid late sowing as this may result in low yield due to high temperatures before maturity of the crop. Actually, sowing time depends on the region/states. When it comes to spacing for pure or solo crop, row spacing of 45-50 cm x 20-25 cm and for mixed crop or intercrop, row spacing of 20-25 cm x 20-25 cm and for rainfed crop, a row spacing of 60 cm x 30-35 cm should be followed. Safflower is usually planted at a depth of 30 to 45 mm. On an average, 10 kg of seeds are enough for covering 1 hectare land. Again seed rate depends on the area and variety. Healthy seeds of improved varieties should be selected for sowing. Find the high yielding cultivar for your region from agriculture department.\r\n\r\nIrrigation in Safflower Cultivation:- \r\nIn India, this crop is mostly grown in areas where less rain fall is expected and no availability of irrigation. However, one can expect higher yields with irrigation. If the soil has enough moisture at the time of sowing, it is very likely to respond to irrigation. Watering or moisture in the soil is very important at the time of flowering and grain filling stages, hence one irrigation in a month should be provided after planting as this helps in better growth of the safflower crop.\r\n\r\nWeed Management in Safflower Cultivation:- \r\nWeed competition is a serious problem in safflower cultivation. You should have good weed control program to get maximum yield. Weed control is critical task in safflower cultivation and this crop is very susceptible to weed competition using its rosette stage. The weeding can be controlled manually or mechanically (chemically) as part of intercultural operations in safflower cultivation. Timely weeding is important and should be carried out one in 2 to 3 weeks. Pre-emergence application of atrazine @ 0.75 kg/ha should be applied control the weeds effectively. Give one additional intercultural or hoeing using manual/bullock-drawn hoes/harrows/sweeps in December well before the crop canopy is closed and the spines become problematic.\r\n\r\nInter crop in Safflower Cultivation:- Safflower is more popular as a mixed or intercrops with other Rabi crops such as wheat, sorghum, linseed, coriander and gram than as sole or pure crop. A sole crop of safflower is, however, more profitable.\r\n\r\nManures and Fertilizers in Safflower Cultivation:-\r\nGenerally, well rotten farm yard manure of 20 tonnes/ha should be applied  during land preparation at the time of last ploughing. When it comes to N:P (P2O5):K (K2O) application, 40:40:20 kg/ha should be applied at the time of sowing. The fertilizers should be applied in furrows 9-10 cm deep and 4-5 cm away from the seed at the time of planting.\r\n\r\nCrop Rotation in Safflower Cultivation:– Crop rotation is very important in safflower cultivation. Safflower crop is mostly grown as a mixed crop with wheat, barley, gram, lentil, Rabi sorghum, coriander.  Three rows of safflower are planted after every 9, 12 or more rows of main crop. Safflower is sown as a border crop around wheat, barley, gram, Rabi sorghum and coriander plots in order to prevent trespass by cattle or any other animals. A pure or solo crop is rotated with green gram, cowpea, black gram, groundnut, sorghum, upland rice, soybean, maize, cotton, pearl millet,  Setaria, sesame etc. in different parts of the country. Safflower crop should never be grown on the same field for two consecutive years.\r\n\r\nPests and Diseases in Safflower Cultivation:– \r\nThe most serious diseases in safflower cultivation are alternaria leaf spot and pseudomonas bacterial blight. Another important factor is safflower should never be planted on the same field for 2 consecutive years. Safflower crop is relatively free of insect attacks and in case of any pests, contact local agriculture department.\r\n\r\nNote: Contact your local Agriculture department for pests and disease symptoms and their control. They are the best source for disease control solutions in safflower cultivation.\r\n\r\nHarvest and Threshing in Safflower Cultivation:– \r\nSafflower crop will be ready for cutting when most of the leaves turn into brown and the stems are dry, but not brittle. Seeds should rub off freely from the least mature heads. Usually, the high yielding varieties of safflower mature in 4 to 5 months. Cut the plants with the help of sharp sickles at the base stalk them in the field fry up fully. For easy handling and transport to the threshing yard, use socks and gloves made from gunny bags to protect legs and hands against spines. Thresh the safflower seeds either by beating with sticks or with the help of bullocks drawn stone-rollers.\r\n\r\nYield in Safflower Cultivation:-\r\nYield depends on many factors like seed variety, climate, soil type and crop management practices. On an average, one can expect 1.5 to 2.5 tonnes/ha from safflower crop depending on seed cultivar and other factors.\r\n', 2482, 2969),

Top dressing  must be completed before bulb development.\r\n\r\nIrrigation in Onion Farming :-\r\nIrrigation is necessary at the time of transplanting/dibbling of cloves and light irrigation should be done on third day after planting and subsequent irrigation will be done at   7-10 days interval depending upon the soil condition and season.Water the transplants immediately after planting. Because of the shallow root system, onions require frequent furrow irrigation. Avoid overhead irrigation, which causes foliage diseases. If the foliage has an unhealthy, yellowish tint the plants are being over-irrigated. The soil will be overly dry around an under-watered crop and may become cracked. Onions generally require 30? of irrigation during a growing season and the closer to harvest, the greater the need for water. If the onion does not get enough water it will not make a large bulb. When the necks start falling over and the onions mature, watering should be discontinued and the soil allowed to dry.\r\n\r\nMicroirrigation & Fertigation in onion farming :-\r\nBy using drip and sprinklers, irrigation should be done  once in three days. The operating pressure for drip system is 1.5kg/cm2 and for rotary micro sprinkler is 2.5kg/cm2. Through drip, fertigation should be done  by using nitrogen fertilizers (Urea). Apply 50% N as basal dose and remaining 50% of N to be applied in seven splits (10 days interval up to 70 days after transplanting) through drip .\r\n\r\nWeed Control and Management in Onion farming :-\r\nCrop should be kept weed free for good bulb yield. For transplanted onion, pre emergence application of Oxyflurofen (Goal) @ 0.15-0.25 kg ai/ha or Fluchloralin (Basalin) @1.0kg/ha or Pendimethalin (Stomp) 3.5 l/ha combined with one hand weeding was found effective in both kharif and rabi seasons.\r\n For onion nursery and direct seeded crop, application of Pendimethalin @3ml/litre just after sowing is found best in controlling weeds without affecting the germination, seedling growth and final stand.\r\n\r\nCropping Rotation :-\r\n Crop rotation is very important in onion farming process Soybean in kharif season followed by onion in rabi season is the best crop rotation which improves soil fertility as well as monetary returns.\r\n\r\nHarvesting,Yielding &Storage:-\r\n\r\nHarvesting Onions:Onions should be harvested at 50% neck fall stage.Follow harvesting of onion bulbs at right stage of maturity. It is important in deciding storage life of onion as bulbs may be stored for about six months.\r\n\r\nThe onion bulbs, reach maturity when the plants cease to produce new leaves and roots. In onion, neck fall is the indication of maturity. Time of harvesting depends on several factors tike planting season, cultivar, market price and condition of the crop. In general, when about 50 percent neck fall is seen crop is harvested. Onion for storage should be fully developed. Thick-neck bulbs which result due to premature harvesting do not store well. Late harvesting leads to increased respiration, subsequent susceptibility to diseases and excessive sprouting during prolonged storage and left in field sunburn is also noticed. Bulbs are harvested by hand pulling if soil is light; they are also harvested by hand implements. Kharif crop, since the growth continues forced toppling should be taken up to stop growth 15 days before harvesting. Onion along with tops are kept in field for 2-3 days, curing for 3-4 days is necessary to remove excess moisture from outer skin and neck to reduce shrinkage and development of colour in storage.\r\n\r\nOnion Yield: Onion (Kharif) 15-20t/ha Onion (Late kharif) 30-35t/ha Onion (Rabi) 25-30t/ha\r\n', 300, 2000),
(12, 'Sugarcane', 'Climatic requirement:\r\nTemperature for different critical stages of sugarcane: The different critical stages are germination, tillering, early growth, active growth and elongation. Optimum temperature for sprouting (germination) of stem cuttings is 32° to 38°c. It slows down below 25°, reaches plateau between 30°-34°. Temperatures above 38° reduce the rate of photosynthesis and increase respiration. For ripening, however, relatively low temperatures in the range of 12° to 14° are desirable.\r\n\r\nReduction in yield of sugarcane due to rise in temperature:\r\nThe sugarcane productivity and juice quality are profoundly influenced by weather conditions prevailing during the various crop-growth sub-periods. Sugar recovery is highest when the weather is dry with low humidity; bright sunshine hours, cooler nights with wide diurnal variations and very little rainfall during ripening period. These conditions favour high sugar accumulation. The climatic conditions like very high temperature or very low temperature deteriorate the juice quality and thus affecting the sugar quality. Favourable climate like warm and humid climate favour the insect pests and diseases, which cause much damage to the quality and yield of its juice and finally sucrose contents.\r\n\r\nArea, production and yield of sugarcane in major growing states:\r\nIn Tropical zone Maharashtra is the major sugarcane growing state covering about 9.4 lakh ha area with production of 61.32 Million ton, whereas the productivity of Tamil Nadu is highest in tropical zones. Uttar Pradesh is the highest sugarcane producing State in sub tropical zone having area about 22.77 Lakh ha with the production of 135.64 Million Ton cane whereas Haryana has highest productivity of sugarcane in Sub tropical zone.', 230, 230),
(13, 'Grapes', 'Suitable Soil for grape farming :-\r\n Types: Grapes are found cultivated on a variety of soil types.

They are closed with topsoil, up to a height of 45 cm after 15 days exposure to sun. The remaining gap is filled with a mixture of soil, cattle manure, single superphosphate, sulphate of potash and micro-nutrients. Usually, 50 kg of cattle manure, 2.5 kg of superphosphate, 0.5 kg of sulphate of potash and 50 g each of ZnSO4 and FeSO4 are added to the soil for every running meter length of the trench.\r\n\r\nBest Planting Season for Grape Farming:-\r\nThe best season for planting the rooted cuttings of cultivated varieties in the main field is September-October whereas for rootstocks it is February-March.\r\n\r\nSpacing in Grape Farming :-\r\nDistance generally varies with the varieties and soil fertility.\r\n\r\nSystem                        Planting Distance   Number of Vines Per Hectare       \r\n\r\nHead system    2m X 1.5m             3300\r\n\r\nKniffin system             3m X 3m                1089\r\n\r\nBower system              3m X 6m               561\r\n\r\nPruning of Vines in grape farming:-\r\nPruning should be done in January every year when the vines are still dormant. Keep only healthy fruiting canes with the recommended number of buds per cane depending upon the cultivar.\r\n\r\nThe rest of shoots are pruned to one or two buds. These are called renewal spurs. These spurs sprout to give healthy shoots which are selected as fruiting canes in the coming years. A balance 1: 2 is kept between fruiting cane and renewal spurs. In Madhurai area staggered pruning is done to get fruit all along the year.\r\n\r\nIn the mild tropical areas, vines are pruned two times & the crop is harvested twice. In varieties like Gulabi and Bangalore Blue, which are fairly resistant to rain damage and in which fruit bud differentiation is not impaired by cloudy weather and rains, pruning is done at any time of the year. As a result, five crops are harvested every two years.\r\n\r\nIn hot tropical areas, vines are pruned two times but only one crop is harvested. All canes in a vine are pruned back to single node spurs in March-May to develop canes and the canes are forward pruned in October-November for fruiting. The number of nodes retained on a cane varies with the variety and cane thickness. There is no scope to prune earlier than October and later than November due to unfavorable climate conditions.\r\n\r\nManures and Fertilizers used in grape farming :-\r\nAs vineyard soils are either sandy loams or heavy clays, the usage of organic manure has assumed critical and high importance in India.To the recently planted vines apply 20 gm of urea in March and repeat the dose in May and July to complete the growth up the bower in one season. From second year onward for vines planted at 3 x 3 m distance the following fertilizers doses and schedule may be adopted.\r\n\r\nApply whole farm yard Manure (FYM) and super phosphate as well as half N and half K fertilizer just after pruning. Apply remaining N and K after fruit set in April. Use of these does have encouraged excessive vegetative growth on all vines irrespective of the system of training adopted, particularly in clay loam soils.\r\n\r\nWeeding control in grape farming :-\r\nVines are planted closely and normally on bower system, hence due to shade weeds could make little growth. But in vineyards trained on kniffin and head system the weeds get ample irrigation, nutrition and light to flourish.Therefore, it is very necessary to control the weeds\r\n\r\nWeeds between the rows of vines are removed mechanically by tractor drawn implements. Within the rows, weeds are manually hoed and removed. Sometimes the post-emergent weedicides, mainly glyphosate at about 2.0 kg/ha or paraquat at about 7.5 kg/ha is sprayed in fully grown vineyards.\r\n\r\nInter cropping: No inter crop should be grown in vineyards as growing of inter crop shall be at the cost of training of vines.\r\n\r\nHarvesting & Yielding:-\r\nGrapes must be harvested only when all the berries have developed the unique colour and desired TSS of the cultivar.\r\n\r\nGrapes are harvested by repeated pickings since the bunches do not ripen at one time. Taste is the most valuable indicator of the ripeness of the bunch. The berries at the shoulders ripe first followed by centre and tip of the clusters.\r\n', 1500, 11000),
(14, 'Moong Dal', 'Agro-Climatic conditions for Green Gram Cultivation:- \r\nBest climatic condition for Green gram cultivation  is warm humid and within temperature range of 25°C – 35°C, with moderate rains of 85 to 100 cm, well distributed throughout its growing period of 100 days.\r\n\r\nBest season to grow Green Gram:- \r\nUsually March to  June period has high temperature and low humidity and this will keep insects and diseases at their lowest. Green Gram is cultivated during warm and wet Kharif season in North India where as in South India in mild winter season.\r\n\r\nSoil requirement in Green Gram Cultivation:- \r\nGreen Gram can be cultivated in wide range of soils, from black cotton soils in North India red laterite soils in South India and sandy soils in Rajasthan. For best production of Green Gram One should select the soil like well drained loamy to sandy loam soil. Avoid water logging soils and saline soils as they are not suitable for green gram cultivation.\r\n\r\nField Preparation in Green Gram Cultivation:- \r\nThe main field selected for Green Gram cultivation must not have been sown with moong or green gram in the previous seasons to avoid volunteer plants that will cause admixture. Prepare main field by plouging for fine tilth and form channels and beds for Green Gram cultivation. To supplement the soil with proper nutrients, apply lime at the rate of 2 tones/ha along with Farm Yard Manure @ 12.5 tones/ha or composted coir pith at 13 tones/ha to get an extra yield of about 15% to 20%.\r\n\r\nSeed Rate in Green Gram Cultivation:-\r\n Seed rate depends on the variety of seed and that may vary from 8 to 10 kg/acre.\r\n\r\nSeed Selection in Green Gram Cultivation:- \r\nSeeds used for cultivation must be form genuine authorized source which will help you to select proper seed that  has genetic purity and seeds must be vigorous to have good field stand. In the process of seed selection, one must check for diseased seeds, hard seeds, shrunken seeds immature seeds, deformed seeds.\r\n\r\nSeed Treatment in Green Gram Cultivation:- \r\nTreat the seeds with Thiram or Carbendazim at 2 grams/kg of seed 1 day before sowing the seeds or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 grams/kg seed or with talc formulation of Trichoderma viride @ 4grams/kg of seed. First treat the Green Gram seeds with Biocontrol agents and then with Rhizobium.\r\n\r\nFertilizers and Manures in Green Gram Cultivation:- \r\nApply the following fertilizers basally before sowing Green Gram seed.\r\n\r\n10 cartloads (5 tones) of well decomposed compost like cow dung or any other good compost should be spread along with basal application of 120 kg super phosphate and 20 kg urea/acre.\r\n•Irrigated condition : 50 kg P2O + 25 kg N + 50 kg P2O5 + 20 kg S /ha.\r\n•Rainfed condition : 25 kg P2O5 + 12.5 kg N + 10 kg S /ha.\r\n\r\nSowing in Green Gram Cultivation:- \r\n  Dibble the Green Gram seeds making a  space of 30 cm x 10 cm in Green Gram farming. In case of bund crop, dibble the seeds with 30 cm spacing.\r\n\r\nIrrigation in Green Gram Cultivation:- \r\n Irrigation should be done after sowing, followed by life irrigation on 3rd day. Irrigate at intervals of 6 to 9 days depending upon climatic conditions and soil type. Irrigation must be provided at flowering & pod formation stages. Make sure soil has proper drainage and avoid water logging at all stages of plant growth. Should apply KCl at 0.5% as foliar spray  during vegetative stage of the crop, if there is any moisture stress.\r\n\r\nWeed control in Green Gram Cultivation:-\r\n As soon as  sowing  and irrigation is done  Basalin weedicide should be applied by dissolving 2 ml of Basalin/ liter of water. The spraying of weedicide must be done within 3 days of sowing the seeds. If done later, it can damage the seed crop. To manage and control later emerging weeds in the crop, manual weeding should be preferred  1 month after of sowing.\r\n\r\nPests and Disease control in Green Gram Cultivation:- \r\nStem fly is the main pest found in this crop. This pest affects the plant at the early stages leading to drying and withering. During the growth stage of moong bean plant, major pests like leaf hopper, aphids, white fly affect the Green Gram crop. These pests can be controlled by spraying either Dimethoate or Phosphomidan, Mehyldematan @ 2 ml per litre of water.\r\n\r\nDuring the growth stages of this crop, yellow mosaic disease can be observed. The impacted plants show yellow mottled symptoms. These plants can be destroyed when they appear on the plants.  Leaf curl diseases and leaf crinkle also found to damage the crop. Remove these kind of plants as soon as they appear. Apart from these diseases this crop is also affected by wilt ,root rot which have to be destroyed & the impacted area can be controlled by sprayed with 0.1 % Bavistin solution. The Powdery mildew and Cercospora can be controlled with spray of 1%   solution of Bavistin.\r\n\r\nHarvesting of Green Gram:- \r\nThe best time to harvest the crop, when 85% of the pods are fully matured. Avoid harvesting in bad weather condition and keep the harvested  stack for drying in the field after cutting on the threshing floor. Remove any admixtures before start of harvesting.\r\n\r\nYield of Green Gram:- \r\nGreen Gram yield depends on the seed  and farm management practices, at an average of  10 to 14 quintals/ha can be expected.', 5800, 7500),
(15, 'Mango', 'Planting Season in Mango Farming:-\r\nPlanting is usually done in the month of July-August in rainfed areas and during February-March in irrigated areas. In case of heavy rainfall zones, planting is taken up at the end of rainy season.\r\n\r\nSpacing in Mango Farming:-\r\nThe planting distance is 10m. x 10m. and 12m. x 12m. in dry and moist zones respectively. In the model scheme, a spacing of 8 meter x 8meter with a population of 63 plants per acre has been considered which was observed to be common in areas covered during a field study.\r\n\r\nTraining of Plants in Mango Farming:-\r\nTraining of plants as part of Mango Farming  in the initial stages of growth is very important to give them a proper shape specially in cases where the graft has branched too low.\r\n\r\nIrrigation or Watering in Mango Farming :-\r\nYoung plants are watered frequently for proper establishment. In case of grown up trees, irrigation at 10 to 15 days interval from fruit set to maturity is beneficial for improving yield. However, irrigation is not recommended for 2-3 months prior to flowering as it is likely to promote vegetative growth at the expense of flowering.\r\n\r\nInter cropping  in Mango Farming:-\r\n Inter crops such as vegetables, legumes, short duration and dwarf fruit crops like papaya, guava, peach, plum, etc. depending on the agro-climatic factors of the region can be grown. The water and nutrient requirements of the inter crops must be met separately.\r\nHarvesting and Yield of Mango Crop:\r\nMango Farming\r\n\r\nThe yield of mango varies greatly, depending upon the variety and agro-climatic conditions prevailing in a region.\r\n Grafted mango trees start bearing from the fifth year onward. However, seedling trees may take 8-10 years.\r\n\r\nAt the start of bearing at the age of 3 – 4 years the yield may be as low as 10-20 fruits (2-3 kg) per tree, rising to 50-75 fruits (10-15 kg) in the subsequent years, and to about 500 fruits (100 kg) in its tenth year. In the age group-20- 40 years, a tree bears 1,000-3,000 fruits (200-600 kg) in an ”on” year. The productive age of a grafted mango tree is usually 40-50 years, after which the yield declines.\r\n\r\nPost Harvest Management in Mango Farming:\r\n\r\nStorage:-\r\nShelf life of mangoes being short (2 to 3 weeks) they are cooled as soon as possible to storage temperature of 13 degree Celcius. A few varieties can withstand storage temperature of 10 degree Celcius. Steps involved in post harvest handling include preparation, grading, washing, drying, waxing, packing, pre-cooling, palletisation and transportation.\r\n\r\nPackaging:-\r\nMangoes are generally packed in corrugated fiber board boxes 40 cm x 30 cm x 20 cm in size. Fruits are packed in single layer 8 to 20 fruits per carton. The boxes should have sufficient number of air holes (about 8% of the surface area) to allow good ventilation.\r\n\r\nFinancial institutions have also formulated mango financing schemes in potential areas for expansion of area under mango. Individual mango development schemes with farm infrastructure facilities like well, pump set, fencing and drip irrigation system etc. have also been considered.\r\n', 1200, 5000),
(16, 'Wheat', 'Climate requirement:\r\nWheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones, but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond even the 60 degree north altitude . Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring .It can be cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.\r\n     The best wheat are produced in areas favoured with cool, moist weather during the major portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the grain to ripen properly. The optimum temperature range for ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25 C though the seeds can germinate in the temperature range 3.5 to 35 c. Rains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight. Areas with a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing.\r\n     During the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and drought are harmful to wheat. Cloudy weather, with high humidity and low temperatures is conducive for rust attack. Wheat plant requires about 14-15 c optimum average temperature at the time of ripening . The temperature conditions at the time of grain filling and development are very crucial for yield. Temperatures above 250c during this period tend to depress grain weight. When temperatures are high, too much energy I lost through the process of transpiration by the plants and the reduced residual energy results in poorer grain formation and lower yields. Wheat is mainly a rabi (winter) season crop in India.\r\n\r\nSoil:\r\nWheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Care should be taken to avoid very porous and excessively drained oils. Soil should be neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb and retain rain water well. Heavy soils with poor structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive to water logging. Wheat can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.\r\n\r\nFertilizer management:\r\nThe time and placement of fertilizer is another area where significant progress was made. It was demonstrated that 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 30 kg potash per hectare were required for optimum productivity. The N was to be applied in two split doses of 60 kg as basal and the remaining 60 kg at first irrigation and full phosphorus and potash to be applied as basal. Recently, the new wheat varieties have responded up to 180 kg N/ha with optima dose around 150 kg/ha. In the Indo-Gangetic plains, application of zinc @ 25kg/ha in rice-wheat system was found to increase the yield substantially. Recently, the use of sulphur has been found beneficial for enhancing the productivity as well as the grain protein content of wheat. Response to Mn (pockets in the Indo-Gangetic plains) and boron (eastern and far eastern region) has also been realized.\r\n\r\nNutrient management:\r\nWith intensive agriculture, deficiency of essential nutrients has also become wide spread. The work conducted under the All India Coordinated Research Project on Micronutrient in Crops and Soils, has shown wide spread deficiency of zinc in soils in India. At the national level, the deficiency level in micro nutrients is Zn: 46 %, B: 17 %, Mo: 12 %, Fe: 11 % and Cu: 5%. The deficiency of sulphur has also been reported across a wide range of soils (38%).The yield response to sulphur has been obtained in more than 40 crops including cereal, millets, oilseeds and pulses etc. To realize the potential yield, strategies may include-\r\n(1) Site specific nutrient management for targeted yields\r\n(2) Integration of crop residues, bio fertilizers etc with inorganic fertilization\r\n(3) Tillage techniques like FIRBS for increasing nutrient use efficiencies\r\n(4) Remote sensing for efficient Nutrient management\r\n(5) Nutrient management, straw quality vis-à-vis human and animal health.\r\n', 1400, 1890);
